TITLE:Fitness app

DESCRIPTION: A andriod application that allows user to track all types of Workouts and their nutrition as well. While giving recommendations to the user.

VISION STATEMENT: Encourage exercise and motivation effiecient progress tracking

MOTIVATION: There are no apps on the Google play store that effiecently track workouts and nutrition. Also tracking workouts help motivate people to workout more often.

RISK: The major risk in taking on this progect is that no one in our group has experience in making andriod applications. Inaddition the amount of ideas that we have planed for the app my be too much for such a small group.

Stratigies to midigate this risk: Dive right into learning how to code for an andriod app. Also scale back our project if it seems that our perivous ideas are too amibitions

USER STORIES: 1) (30) As user I want to be able to track multiple sets of different workouts at once so that I can gauge what I should lift next week 2) (40) As a user I want to be able to track my nutrition with my workouts so that I can gauge how many calories I can eat 3) (50 ) As a user I want to be able to enter in my runs so that I can track my time improvements 4) (200) As a user I want to be able to integrate data from my fitbit so that I can have all my fitness data in one app 5) (35) As a user I want a timer in the app so that I can use one app throughout my whole workout 6) (25) As a user I want a rep to max calculator so that I can gauge what weight I should lift PROJECT TRACKING SOFTWARE: TRELLO-https://trello.com/b/wcYVinya
